<h1>My Story</h1>

<p>
 My name is Dinara, I live in Antalya with my two wonderful daughters.

I was born in Kazakhstan and graduated from Abai Kazakh National Pedagogical University in 2005 with a degree in History and Educational Management.
My life is all about finding balance between family, work, and inspiration. I work as a sworn translator and entrepreneur, which allows me to connect with people and discover new cultures.
My stories are about being a mom and a professional at the same time, about keeping dreams alive and believing in the best. As a single mom, I want my daughters to be proud of me — and today, it’s their love and support that give me the strength to move forward.
